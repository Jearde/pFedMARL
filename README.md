# pFedMARL - Personalized Federated Learning with Multi-Agent Off-Policy Reinforcement Learning

**Project status: pre-release**  
The public codebase is still being refactored and aligned with our internal implementation.
A fully cleaned-up, reproducible version including complete documentation and tests will be pushed no later than the companion paperâ€™s formal publication.
Thank you for your patience while we prepare a robust release.
